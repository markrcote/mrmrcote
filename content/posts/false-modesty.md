As a manager, you are, by definition, an authority figure. There is no getting around that in 99% of modern organizations, at least those that employ high-tech workers. You may not have complete control over your reports' employment, but it's pretty close. There is no getting around this. That is not to say that you need to be distant and aloof with your team, but this power relationship can't be ignored.

If you're somewhere in middle management, it's also important not to downplay the effect your words have on skip levels. You may not like it, but when people joke about "the big boss" they aren't entirely making it up. It's nice to see that someone up the pyramid who presumably has a bunch of stuff to look after (or they're just off playing golf, but either way) has spent some focus time getting to know your day-to-day work.

This authority actually often extends beyond your team. Expect that people on other teams will take your words more seriously than they would if they were coming from a peer. If you're not aware of this, it's easy for a random suggestion to become marching orders without you even knowing it.

The negative effects of false modesty in a power imbalance aren't confined to those on the people track. The authority inherent in the role of an upper-level IC, particularly staff and above, is something that needs to be understood and accepted. It's all too easy for a principal developer to see themselves as just another programmer, perhaps just with more exacting standards, and to not fully recognize or integrate the fact that many people look up to this person. Regardless of whether power and authority are desired by the technical leader, they are imbued in the role. Expect that your statements carry weight and will usually be at least considered, if not automatically accepted, as the best way forward. Conversely, and perhaps more importantly, any stance you take _against_ something will be taken seriously by many people, who may not understand your full reasoning.
