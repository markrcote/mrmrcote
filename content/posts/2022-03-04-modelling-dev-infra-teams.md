Last year I wrote a post for the Shopify engineering blog on the subject of [Modelling Developer Infrastructure Teams](https://shopify.engineering/modelling-developer-infrastructure-teams). I figured I should link to it here as well. I've had several industry peers reach out to me to exchange notes on building dev-infra teams, so it seems the topic resonated with some people!
