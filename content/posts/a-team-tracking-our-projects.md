Keeping wiki pages up to date is a hard problem, but recently we found out
that people were having trouble finding out what projects we were working on.
Obviously we can't help people with their problems if they can't figure out
what we do, so I spent some time today updating the
[A-Team's Project Central](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects). All
the projects we are working on are there, along with owners' IRC nicks and
links to project pages and/or docs.  We also have links to our quarterly goals
as well as to SmartSheet pages with details of our progress.

We'll do our best to keep it up to date!
